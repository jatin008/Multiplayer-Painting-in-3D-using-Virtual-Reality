## Multiplayer-Painting-in-3D-using-Virtual-Reality
### Problem Description
The aim of this project is to develop a multiplayer Virtual Reality Painting application where multiple players can draw and paint inside a 3D VR environment at the same time. The drawing can be considered as “tangible” entities in the VR world and the application allows multiple players to explore and enjoy it by using a VR headset and controller, instead of ancient tools (pencils and pens etc.) at the same time.
